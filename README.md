# Alarm-clock-GUI
Logic:
We have to match the current time with the new given time for the alarm to ring.

Libraries:
- datetime
- tkinter
- time
- winsound

Steps:
1) Importing all the libraries and modules required.
2) Putting forward a while loop which takes the argument of the time, the user wants to set the alarm on and automatically breaks when the time is up, with sound.
3) Create a display window for user input.
